#This use case is for a gradaute student (GS) with introductory electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, computer file management, and programming.

### Perform a general impedance fit ###

1. GS creates a three columned csv file of the data where first column is frequency, the second column is real impedance, and the third column is imaginary impedance.
1. GS place the csv file in the Impedance-Fitting/main/General-Circuit.
1. GS opens a python shell.
1. GS changes working directory to the directory Impedance-Fitting/main/General-Circuit.
1. GS places variables in config.py.
1. GS Run Test_fitting.py.
1. Program generates fitting report in csv including fitted parameteres and their associated error. 
1. Program generates Nyquist and Bode plots comparing input data to fit.
